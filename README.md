ABOUT
FIXSTHLM is a platform for engaging Stockholmers with their city, helping them to report & share issues in an easy accessible way.It was built by three Digital Data Strategy students at Hyper Island Stockholm during three weeks while learning to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript and utilize APIs for their studies.

HOW IT WORKS
Utilizing Twitter data sent to account @fixstockholm, FIXSTHLM visualize on Google Maps and separate list issues reported from Stockholm by the users.Initial version is built to enable the communication channel and visualization for the input from users.

Possible second phase would include interactivity to up/downvote and comment issues by users and mark them as completed.
For this purpose a Firebase or other database needs to be created. Further development timeline is not yet decided.
