  <h1>HELLO STOCKHOLM</h1>

    <strong>FixSthlm</strong> is a place where citizens can share and report ideas to improve and develop their local neighborhoods. It's a digital forum to inspire action. It collects real-time, qualified data to  portray the condition of Stockholm as seen through the eyes of its citizens.<br>
    <br>

    We see this tool as a step toward more engaging dialogue and direct contact between the citizens and municipality. We see a need for a transition from an out-dated approach of community engagement such as questionnaires and City Hall meetings to an active use of modern communication methods. 
    We consider <strong>FixSthlm</strong> as a one small step on this long road. Modern cities should be accessible to all and its evolvement should be portrayed as a real-time image, both for the benefit of its decision-makers and citizens. <br>

     We are three Digital Data Strategy students from Hyper Island who had a vision and limited coding experience. As part of our studies, we built in two weeks build this beta version of FixSthlm. It is an open source project, source code is found at <a href="https://github.com/juueli/FIXSTHML">Github</a> and can be used to further develop the features of the site.<br>
     <br>

    We envision that FixSthlm can be much more than a place to report what is wrong in the city. We see a possibility to create a platform that enables citizens of all ages to document and share their personal experiences, likes and dislikes and ideas for change in their city or neighborhood.<br>
    <br>


    We aim to affect the city in a positive way by using modern communication channels and open data to encourage dialogue between the city and its citizens. If you are interested in the project, please contact us.<br>
